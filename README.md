# Practical ML Project

The following project is part of a [Coursera Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)

In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. A report is also generated describing how the process.
